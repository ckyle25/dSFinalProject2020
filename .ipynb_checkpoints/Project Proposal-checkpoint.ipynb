There is likely going to be a degree of seasonality associated with both sets largely tied to weather patterns. A simple line graph could display these trends in an informative way. It would be interesting to look at a dual axis graph with date being the common denominator. Once we look for patterns in the individual dataset, they will be combined and the typical corrleation visualizations will be done. Looking at both a heatmap of the correlation matrix and a scatter-matrix of the data will give us an idea of where correlations (if any) exist."

Given that we are trying to predict the number of accidents based on an array of continuous ratio variables, an initial approach could be to use linear regression. If relationships are actually non-linear, the next model attempt could revolve around descision trees or random forest analyses."
