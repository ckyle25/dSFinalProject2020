    "Accidents happen all the time. On average, there are over 5,891,000 vehicle crashes each year. Approximately 21% of these crashes - nearly 1,235,000 - are weather-related. Weather-related crashes are defined as those crashes that occur in adverse weather.<br/><br/>\n",
    "          According to utah.heath.gov, accidents occur in Utah every 10 minutes, a person is injured in a crash every 23 minutes, and a person dies in a crash every 36 hours. There are many reasons what cause crashes in Utah; speed, failure to keep in the proper lane, distracted driving, etc. However, we believe that bad weather and temperature is often a major contributing factor that people get into car crashes. <br/><br/>\n",
    "          Being Utah residents we especially care about our friends and family’s safety. Utah has the most unpredictable weather conditions. People driving in poor conditions need to be extra careful, whether its snow, rain or wind. It is the drivers’ duty to adapt to road conditions, and avoid crashes. \n",
    "That motivated us to construct a model that can predict the number of accidents in Utah based on conducted information on Utah accidents and weather data. "

    "  3. What values are important to use or consider, to predict the number of accidents?<br/><br/> \n",
    "We are sampling the data with different approaches to learn the differences between weather, time, temperature, seasons that cause car accidents. We would like to know if data science can help us to accomplish our goals and understand what factors cause accidents. Does snow or wind really have a significant outcomes on a number of crashes in Utah?\n",
    "Our goal is to predict if weather conditions have a major impact on crashes in Utah. The benefits that anyone can receive from this project analysis can be examined and used while driving in different weather conditions.  Everyone knows that more accidents occur during bad weather conditions. We can visualize the data and express it in charts, graphs, etc. "

There is likely going to be a degree of seasonality associated with both sets largely tied to weather patterns. A simple line graph could display these trends in an informative way. It would be interesting to look at a dual axis graph with date being the common denominator. Once we look for patterns in the individual dataset, they will be combined and the typical corrleation visualizations will be done. Looking at both a heatmap of the correlation matrix and a scatter-matrix of the data will give us an idea of where correlations (if any) exist."

Given that we are trying to predict the number of accidents based on an array of continuous ratio variables, an initial approach could be to use linear regression. If relationships are actually non-linear, the next model attempt could revolve around descision trees or random forest analyses."
